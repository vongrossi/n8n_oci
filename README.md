# n8n on Oracle Cloud (Always Free)

> One-click deployment of n8n on Oracle Cloud Free Tier.

[![Deploy to Oracle Cloud](https://github.com/clementalo9/oke_A1/blob/main/images/Deploy2OCI.svg)](https://cloud.oracle.com/resourcemanager/stacks/create?zipUrl=https://github.com/clementalo9/n8n_oci/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

## ✨ Features
- Runs on VM.Standard.A1.Flex (ARM, free tier)
- Public IP access on port 5678
- SSH access on port 22
- Basic auth enabled out of the box
- Deployable via Oracle Cloud Resource Manager or Terraform CLI

## 📝 Prerequisites
You must first create a free Oracle Cloud account here:
👉 https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/

Oracle requires a valid credit card for identity verification, but as long as you stay in the Always Free tier, you will not be charged.

This project uses the `VM.Standard.A1.Flex` instance type, which is included in the Always Free tier with the following limits:
- **4 OCPUs**
- **24 GB RAM**
- **2 VMs max per tenancy**

n8n will run comfortably within those limits.

## 🚀 Quick Deploy (recommended)
Click the button above to deploy automatically in your Oracle tenancy.

1. Log into your Oracle Cloud account
2. Select your compartment
3. Launch the stack and follow the prompts
   (Resource Manager will ask for `vm_admin_user`, `vm_admin_password`,
   and `ssh_public_key`)

## 🔧 Manual Deployment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/clementalo9/n8n_oci.git
cd n8n_oci/terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
```

### Tenancy OCID
When running `terraform apply` manually, pass your tenancy OCID:

```bash
terraform apply -var "tenancy_ocid=<your-tenancy-ocid>"
```

Oracle Resource Manager sets this variable automatically when deploying via the console.

### Image OCID
When running Terraform manually, you must also provide the OCID of an Ubuntu
image compatible with your region:

```bash
terraform apply -var "image_ocid=<ocid>"
```

You can find available Ubuntu image OCIDs in the Oracle Cloud Console under
"Images" for your chosen region.

## 🔐 Default Credentials
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `strongpassword`

> Change them in `docker-compose.yml` after first deployment.

### VM Credentials
The Terraform variables `vm_admin_user`, `vm_admin_password`, and `ssh_public_key`
configure the SSH login for the created virtual machine. OCI Resource Manager
will prompt for these values when launching the stack.

## 🌐 Accessing n8n
Go to `http://<your-instance-public-ip>:5678`

✅ Optional: You may configure a custom domain and SSL certificate with Certbot. While not required, it is strongly recommended for production.

## 📂 Structure
 - `terraform/`: OCI resources (VCN, subnet, instance)
 - `scripts/`: Cloud-init script with Docker + n8n setup
 - `backend/`: Express server for sending email and SMS notifications
 - `frontend/`: Example page using notifications.js to call the backend

## 🛡️ SSL/TLS (optional)
You need a domain name to use Let's Encrypt. We recommend [DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org) for a free domain name and simple DNS.

## ✅ Final Check
- Ports 22, 80, 443 and 5678 must be open
- Public IP provided by OCI is sufficient to access the UI
- Domain + SSL optional but recommended for production
